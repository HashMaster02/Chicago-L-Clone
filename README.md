# Subway System Clone
This repo contains code that aims to mimic a subway system for 
a city (based on the Chicago 'L').

___This project is no longer under development by me. Due to
time constraints, I decided to abandon the project and move-on
to others. Feel free to continue its development by cloning
the repo.___

Given a database of stations containing each station's:
* Name
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Elevation (Elevated, Subway, Ground-level, etc.)
* Accessibility
* Position on each line

The system can route between two stations that are on the same 
line, giving a list of stops along the way. It also allows you to:
* Add new stations
* Update information about stations
* Delete stations
* Look-up information about a particular station

This project does **NOT** include:
* The ability to read data in from a database
* A functioning UI (terminal-based or otherwise)

### Development Info
* Unit tests are written using JUnit.
* Developed using Intellij IDE
