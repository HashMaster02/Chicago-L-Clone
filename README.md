# Subway System Clone
This repo contains code that aims to mimic a subway system for 
a city (based on the Chicago 'L').

___This project is currently under development, so all features
may not be available.___

Given a database of stations containing each station's:
* Name
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Elevation (Elevated, Subway, Ground-level, etc.)
* Accessibility
* Position on each line

The system can route between any two stations, giving a list
of stops along the way, and telling you when to switch trains
if necessary. It also allows you to:
* Add new stations
* Update information about stations
* Delete stations
* Look-up information about a particular station

### Development Info
* Unit tests are written using JUnit.
* Developed using Intellij IDE
